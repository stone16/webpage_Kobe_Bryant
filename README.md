Project contain several parts.
1) Webpage design. Focus on the data visualization of data from Basketball Reference.
Use html, css, javascript to design the frontend pages. Use some css packages, like bootstrap, font-awesome, uniform, animate. Some js pakages like Jquery, wow, d3.

2) Data
This project does not build a whole websites, which means it does not have server, and database. LoL, designed for fun. Hardcode all data to html is really ugly, thus I use python and bs4 to scrap data from nba reference, and store it in the format of json.
3) Import data
Use d3 package to import data and show them in html.


Future works:
1. scrap data periodly from nba reference, may be use existing client created by others, see nba_py, (https://github.com/seemethere/nba_py)
2. Build database, backend system in java
3. Make it accessible by everyone.
